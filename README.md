# What is fa?

fa (find again) is a command line tool for making streaming walls of text more
human-friendly.  fa processes streaming text input, searches for a regular
expression, and displays the stream to the screen in such a way that the
matching line appears in a consistent position on the screen without scrolling.

This is a work in progress.
